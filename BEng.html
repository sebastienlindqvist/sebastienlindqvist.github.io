								<p>During my Bachelour year of univeristy I had to do a individual project. 
									I chose to build and code a strawberry picking robot that used Computer Vision to find
									the strawberry. 
									It would use a 3 DoF arm moved by a gantry system via belts and 
									powered by 3 stepper motors with an vacuum end effector.
									It uses Computer Vision software called OpenCV and OpenKinect running on a Raspberry Pi
									3B.

									<br />
									The main brain of the robot was a Raspberry pi 3B doing all the OpenCV coding
									and a Arduino Mega connected in via serial to control the stepper motor drivers
									for the gantry system and wheels. The stepper motors were powered by LiPo batteries
									in series.
									<br/>
									In the end it could not be tested due to COVID-19 started and the UK was in lockdown.
									So the only test that could be done was within my bedroom. The vacuum end effector
									did not have enough suction to lift the fake strawberries I created to test the end
									effector. In addition, the Kinect Camera can't see anything closer than a metre which
									I accidentally presumed it could and now the strawberries position from the camera
									cannot be accurately calculated. Therefore, the arm was not able to pick the strawberry
									without me putting in the position of the strawberry from one corner of the gantry
									system. However, after all of this and the failures of the picking robot. I learnt a
									lot in the process which now if I were to start this project again or do something very
									similar, I would know what to do differently and what to do again that worked.

									In the image above, you can see the gantry system of the strawberry picker prior to
									the gantry arm and end effector were altered to have a larger motor and using a vacuum
									system.
