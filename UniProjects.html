									<h1>IMechE Challenge</h1>
									<p>The IMechE challenge was to create a robot that could climb up a pipe. I joined the team
										midway through the competition due to one of the team members asked me to join. If I
										remember correctly, I think it was due to none of them truely knew how to code and
										do correct wiring. So I immediately became in charge of most of the work. For the robot
										to be built on time, I personally done 2 all nighters to make sure the robot is ready
										for the competition.

									<h1>Mars Rover Challenge</h1>
									<p>The Mars Rover challenge was to create a robot that would navigate a mars like terrain with the use of computer vision. 
										I joined the challenge because it sounded interesting. I became the team leader and oversaw the team due to being the 
										3rd year student in the team.
