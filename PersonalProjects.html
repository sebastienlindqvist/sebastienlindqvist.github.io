									<h1>Home Server<br />
										Raspberry Pi Cluster</h1>
									<p>My latest project I am currently working on is setting up a home server that is made out of a Raspebrry Pi 4b and 4 Raspberry Pi Zeros </p>
								</header>
								<div class="image left"><img src="images/server.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>
									This project is my current project and most likely will be my ongoing project. The server
									consists of a 8Gb RAM Raspberry Pi 4B, 4 Raspberry Pi Zeros, ClusterHAT, UPS, OLED and 4 
									Fans.
									The reason for a server is it host my Discord Bot as well as a PiHole to block ads by
									redirecting it. This could have been done by a single Raspberry Pi. However, I added
									the additional Pi Zeros and UPS to allow myself to try out docker, kubernetes, 
									Portainer and future projects and Apps that require more processing power and RAM. For
									example a Minecraft server.
									<br />
									Once I had everything built, I took measurements to allow me to create a case that fits all 
									the electronics as well as a transparent side screen it see the insides as well as have the 
									OLED screen shine through the side displaying information about each of the Raspberry Pis
									as well as the UPS.
									<br />

									<h1>Discord Bots</h1>
								</header>
								<div class="image left"><img src="images/Discord.jpg" alt=""/></div>
								<p> This project was to create a bot that can communicate with the public within
									 my discord server. I wanted to create a server where people with similar interests
									 could talk with one another. However, in order to make it more entertaining and
									 interractive, the server needs bots.
									<br />
									<u>Seraphine:</u><br />
									Seraphine is a bot for allowing music to be played within the server using youtube-dl
									which is an open source software for downloading video and audio from youtube and other
									video hosting websites. I did have an issue when it came to testing Seraphine because
									after downloading all dependecies correctly and running the python script without any
									errors occuring. I tried making Seraphine play music but I could not hear anything being
									played. After multiple attempts of looking up different methods of downloading dependencies,
									the issue was my discord had glitched because when I asked a friend to join and listen,
									they could hear and music being played so I tried connecting from my phone and I could hear
									as well so I had to reinstall Discord.

									<br />
									<u>Ahri:</u> <br />
									Ahri is the second bot that is being made. Her main purpose is to help people who join
									the server for the first time as well as making sure people follow the rules of the server.
									In addition, she will be doing the level keeping as well and possibly more. So far she is
									small fragments of codes.
									<br /> 
									<u>Evelynn:</u> <br />
									Evelynn will be the third bot however, she is still a thought and no actuall coding yet.
									The main reason for Evelynn would be managing all games that are ran on the server.
									<br />
									<br />
									All of these bots are and will be uploaded and ran on the Raspberr Pi Cluster Server
									along with other applications

									<h1>Bespoke Shelf CAD model</h1>
								</header>
								<div class="image left"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>I recently had to upgrade my shelving. I wanted something that looked nice so I decided
									to create a CAD model for it. I was going to make it out of MDF boards so I had to
									design something that was asthetically pleasing yet did not produce a lot of scrap wood.
									<br />
									You can see in the image the fully assembled shelving unit which I cut and built 2 of
									which can be seen with the link below to the github with the CAD files and images.
